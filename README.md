### Overview

*A look into the film industry’s domestic performance.*

Microsoft is interested in starting a film studio. They are looking for data supported insight into what types of films they should produce. For this objective, I will investigate which films perform the best at the box office. For this analysis, best = most profitable.

### Data

The following data being used for this project:
Studio information from IMDB from 2010-2018 containing studio name, title, domestic and foreign gross in USD.

---
### Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

Questions to consider:

How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

Questions to consider:

How do you interpret the results?
How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## 1) Which studios are the domestic leaders?

## 2) What are their production numbers?

## 3) What types of movies are they making?

## 4) Does release date effect box office success ?


---
### Conclusions


The industry is dominated by the large, well established producers creating between 8 and 21 titles per year.

Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Drama were the most utilized descriptors for the movies from these studios.

Movies released in summer (June, July, August) or for have the greatest ROI.

---
### Questions to Consider


Will competing directly in the most populous areas be more likely to lead to success, or are those areas too saturated?

Beyond genre – what are the effects of these factors in driving attendance: remakes, sequels/franchises, based on books/other media, talent - cast/crew.

What is profit/ROI relationship to genre?

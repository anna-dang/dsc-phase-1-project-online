### Overview

*A look into the film industry’s domestic performance.*

My client, Microsoft, is interested in starting a new film production studio. They are looking for data supported insight into what types of films they should produce. For this objective, I will investigate which films perform the best at the box office. For this analysis, best = most profitable.

### Data

The following data was used for this project:
Studio information from IMDB from 2010-2018 containing studio name, title, domestic and foreign gross in USD.

I scrubbed the data of duplicates, missing values and broke apart or merged tables to create the "Clean Data" available in this repo.


#### 1) Which studios are the domestic leaders?

### Conclusions


The industry is dominated by the large, well established producers creating between 8 and 21 titles per year.

Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Drama were the most utilized descriptors for the movies from these studios.

Movies released in summer (June, July, August) or for have the greatest ROI.


### Questions to Consider


Will competing directly in the most populous areas be more likely to lead to success, or are those areas too saturated?

Beyond genre – what are the effects of these factors in driving attendance: remakes, sequels/franchises, based on books/other media, talent - cast/crew.

What is profit/ROI relationship to genre?
